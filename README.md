# NoteVis
A colorful music composition editor and sightreading program written in C++.

Libraries used:
- **SDL 2** + **OpenGL** for backend rendering
- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui for higher level rendering and UI (temporary, plan to create my own UI framework later)
- https://github.com/jcelerier/libremidi for MIDI file IO
