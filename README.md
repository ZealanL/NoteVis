# NoteVis
A colorful music composition editor and sightreading program written in C++.

**Windows Only (for now)**: I will implement the rest of the Linux-side code soon™️

Libraries used:
- https://www.libsdl.org/ for backend rendering (OpenGL)
- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui for higher level rendering and UI (temporary, plan to create my own UI framework later)
- https://github.com/jcelerier/libremidi for MIDI file IO
- https://zlib.net/ for convenient compression/decompression
